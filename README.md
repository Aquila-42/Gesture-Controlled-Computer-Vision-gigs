# Gesture-Controlled-Computer-Vision-gigs
A high-performance WebGL simulation combining Astrophysics with Computer Vision. Using Google MediaPipe, I implemented a gesture-control system to manipulate a 3D black hole model. Features 150k+ particles, custom noise-flow shaders, and pinch-to-zoom logic. A study in mapping human input to complex mathematical environments.
